Superfluous is a Battlefield 2 server administration program for Windows 2K/XP
(also should work in Wine and Win9x/NT), the BF2 server requires BF2CC and
ModManager scripts version 4.6 or later with PunkBuster enabled.

Requirements

  - Windows 2000/XP and above (untested on NT/ME/9x).
  - Andale Mono font, can be downloaded from:
      http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/corefonts/andale32.exe?download

Targets

  - Commands which are associated with players only work for a "targeted"
    player. When one player is matched with "match" or "smatch", they become
    the target and these commands will only effect this player.
    
    For example, kicking a player called team_killer takes two steps:
      match _killer
      kick "Do not teamkill"

    Only issue the kick command if this is the only player matched and
    the target is announced.

Hot Key

  - Shift+F12 redirects all keyboard input to Superfluous and blocks keyboard
    input to all other programs. Escape or Shift+F12 will set the keyboard back
    to normal. With this mode, Battlefield 2 can be running with Superfluous on
    a second monitor and commands be issued without the need to Alt+Tab.

  - connect <ip>[:<port>] [name]
    Must be an IP address or an alias.

    About Superfluous.

Superfluous.cfg

  - Aliases are in the form of key=value, there should be no whitespace until
    after the equals sign.

  - Servers can be aliased and used via: connect testserver
    As the rcon password is plain text, it will prompted for if not specified.

    testserver=127.0.0.1:16567
    testserver_host_name=Local Server
    testserver_rcon_password=rcon_password
    testserver_admin_name=admin_name

  - Commands can be aliased, c can be used to connect, ls will run listPlayers,
    kicktk will issue a kick command.

    c=connect
    ls=/admin.listPlayers
    kicktk=kick "Killing teammates"

  - Other settings:
    _admin_name: default admin name and used if the admin name is not
                 specified in the server alias.
    _kick_prefix: text before kick message, default is "Kicking"
    _ban_prefix: text before ban message, default is "Banning"
    _separator: separator in kick/ban messages
    _resolve_ip: whether or not to resolve IP address when displaying players,
                 set to true or false to enabled/disable
                 WARNING: if an IP address cannot be resolved then Superfluous
                 WILL FREEZE UNTIL IT TIMES OUT, IT HAS NOT CRASHED. Large
                 lists of players may take a long time to display with this
                 option enabled.

Notes

  - Command and parameter input parsing is not very tolerant and all parameters
    which have spaces in them must be enclosed in quotes.

  - Server information is not automatically updated, if the map changes then
    player's team may be reported incorrectly until the serverinfo command
    is issued.

  - There is a high chance that Superfluous will work under Linux with Wine,
    the only extra required DLL is shlwapi.dll which is part of Windows.
